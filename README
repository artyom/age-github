age-github command is a wrapper to filippo.io/age tool which expands
recipients in -r @username format to first ssh key of github user
"username", fetching keys from https://github.com/username.keys endpoint.

It caches keys for 1 hour in "age-github" subdirectory under os.UserCacheDir
directory.

Github user handles should have @ prefix, i.e. to encrypt file for
https://github.com/artyom user, you call it as

    age-github -r @artyom ...

All other flags/arguments are passed unmodified.
